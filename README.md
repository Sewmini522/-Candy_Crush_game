🍬 Candy Crush – Web Game (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

A simple Candy Crush–style match-3 game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop events, grid logic, tile matching, scoring, and basic animations.



🎮 Game Overview

In this Candy Crush mini-game:
     The board is an 12x12 grid of colorful candies.
     You can drag and swap two candies.
     If 3 or more of the same candy line up (horizontal or vertical):
              They disappear
              You earn points
              New candies fall from the top
    If the swap doesn't make a match → the candies return to their original position
    The game continues until no more moves are possible.
